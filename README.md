# Self-Led Computer Science Degree

This repository documents my journey through a self-led computer science curriculum, equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, utilizing resources from MIT OpenCourseWare, edX, Coursera, and other platforms.

## Curriculum Plan

The curriculum is structured as follows:

### Prerequisites
*   Basic Math: High school-level algebra and basic calculus.
*   Time Commitment: 15–20 hours/week.
*   Tools: Computer with internet, Python, Git, and an IDE (e.g., VS Code).
*   Portfolio: Use GitHub to store code and project documentation.

### 1. Introductory Courses
*   [MIT OCW 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](01-Introductory-Courses/MIT-6.0001-Intro-to-Python)
*   [Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](01-Introductory-Courses/Harvard-CS50-Intro-to-CS)

### 2. Core Courses
*   [MIT OCW 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms](02-Core-Courses/MIT-6.006-Intro-to-Algorithms)
    *   Supplementary: [Georgia Tech: Data Structures & Algorithms I](02-Core-Courses/GeorgiaTech-Data-Structures-Algorithms-1)
*   [MIT OCW 6.042J: Mathematics for Computer Science](02-Core-Courses/MIT-6.042J-Math-for-CS)
*   [MIT OCW 6.004: Computation Structures](02-Core-Courses/MIT-6.004-Computation-Structures)
*   [University of Wisconsin: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](02-Core-Courses/Wisconsin-OSTEP-Operating-Systems)
*   [Stanford Online: Introduction to Databases](02-Core-Courses/Stanford-Intro-to-Databases)
*   [UBC via edX: Software Engineering: Introduction](02-Core-Courses/UBC-Software-Engineering-Intro)

### 3. Advanced Courses (Choose 2-3)
*   [Harvard CS50 via edX: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](03-Advanced-Courses/Harvard-CS50-Intro-to-AI-with-Python)
*   [RIT via edX: Cybersecurity Fundamentals](03-Advanced-Courses/RIT-Cybersecurity-Fundamentals)
*   [Microsoft via edX: Computer Vision and Image Analysis](03-Advanced-Courses/Microsoft-Computer-Vision)

### 4. Capstone Project
*   [Personal Finance Tracker Web App](04-Capstone-Project/Personal-Finance-Tracker-WebApp)
    *   Technologies: Python (Flask), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQLite, scikit-learn

## Learning Strategy
*   **Order**: Introductory -> Core -> Advanced -> Capstone.
*   **Schedule**: Dedicate 15–20 hours/week.
*   **Portfolio**: All assignments and projects will be documented on GitHub with clear READMEs.
*   **Community**: Engage with the OSSU Discord community.
*   **Tools**: Python, Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, SQLite.
