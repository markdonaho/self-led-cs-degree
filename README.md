# Self-Led Computer Science Degree

This repository documents my journey through a self-led computer science curriculum, equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, utilizing resources from MIT OpenCourseWare, edX, Coursera, and other platforms.

## Curriculum Plan

The curriculum is structured as follows:

### Prerequisites
*   Basic Math: High school-level algebra and basic calculus.
*   Time Commitment: 15–20 hours/week.
*   Tools: Computer with internet, Python, Git, and an IDE (e.g., VS Code).
*   Portfolio: Use GitHub to store code and project documentation.

### 1. Introductory Courses
*   MIT OCW 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
*   Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

### 2. Core Courses
*   MIT OCW 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms
    *   Supplementary: Georgia Tech: Data Structures & Algorithms I
*   MIT OCW 6.042J: Mathematics for Computer Science
*   MIT OCW 6.004: Computation Structures
*   University of Wisconsin: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
*   Stanford Online: Introduction to Databases
*   UBC via edX: Software Engineering: Introduction

### 3. Advanced Courses (Choose 2-3)
*   Harvard CS50 via edX: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
*   RIT via edX: Cybersecurity Fundamentals
*   Microsoft via edX: Computer Vision and Image Analysis (Alternative: MIT OCW 6.801: Machine Vision)

### 4. Capstone Project
*   Agentic Real Estate Disruption Platform
    *   Goal: Create a suite of AI agents to automate and replace traditional real estate agent roles in the home buying/selling process.
    *   Key Features:
        *   Buyer agents for property search, viewing scheduling, offer negotiation.
        *   Seller agents for market analysis, listing creation, marketing, offer management.
        *   Transaction coordination agents.
        *   Development of an alternative to MLS for property listings, potentially using web scraping, public records, and direct submissions. Allowing sellers to directly load their homes is a big deal I suspect!
    *   Technologies: Python, AI/ML frameworks (e.g., LangChain, TensorFlow/PyTorch), web scraping libraries, database technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL or NoSQL alternatives), web frameworks (e.g., Flask/Django or FastAPI).

## Learning Strategy
*   **Order**: Introductory -> Core -> Advanced -> Capstone.
*   **Schedule**: Dedicate 15–20 hours/week.
*   **Portfolio**: All assignments and projects will be documented on GitHub with clear READMEs.
*   **Community**: Engage with the OSSU Discord community.
*   **Tools**: Python, Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, SQLite.
