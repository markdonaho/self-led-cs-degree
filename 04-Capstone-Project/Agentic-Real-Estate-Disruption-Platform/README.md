# Agentic Real Estate Disruption Platform

## Project Goal
Create a suite of AI agents to automate and replace traditional real estate agent roles in the home buying/selling process, aiming to disrupt the existing real estate market.

## Key Features
*   **Buyer Agents**: AI agents capable of:
    *   Understanding buyer preferences.
    *   Searching and filtering property listings (including from a custom, non-MLS database).
    *   Scheduling property viewings.
    *   Assisting with offer generation and negotiation.
*   **Seller Agents**: AI agents capable of:
    *   Performing comparative market analysis (CMA).
    *   Generating compelling property listings.
    *   Marketing properties across various channels.
    *   Managing showing requests and collecting feedback.
    *   Analyzing and managing offers.
*   **Transaction Coordination Agents**: AI agents to:
    *   Guide users through the closing process.
    *   Manage deadlines and required documentation.
    *   Facilitate communication between parties (buyers, sellers, legal, finance).
*   **Alternative Property Listing Platform**:
    *   Develop a system to bypass traditional MLS reliance.
    *   Source listings via:
        *   Web scraping of publicly available real estate data.
        *   Integration with public records.
        *   Direct-to-platform listing capabilities for sellers (a key differentiator).
    *   Provide open access to listings where legally permissible.

## Target Technologies
*   **Core Language**: Python
*   **AI/ML Frameworks**:
    *   Agentic Frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen, or similar)
    *   Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) for tasks like market analysis, image recognition (for listings), and NLP.
*   **Web Scraping**: Libraries such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, or Playwright.
*   **Database Technologies**:
    *   Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
    *   NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch) for flexible data storage, especially for scraped listings or user-generated content.
    *   Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic search and AI memory.
*   **Web Frameworks**:
    *   Backend: Flask, Django, or FastAPI for API development and application logic.
    *   Frontend: (To be decided - e.g., React, Vue, or a simpler templating engine if focusing on agent interactions).
*   **Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability, data storage, and AI model deployment.

## Disruption Strategy
The primary goal is to democratize the real estate process by:
1.  Reducing or eliminating traditional agent commissions.
2.  Providing transparent access to data and processes.
3.  Empowering buyers and sellers with AI-driven tools and insights.
4.  Creating an open and more efficient alternative to closed-off listing systems.

This project aligns with the future of AI by focusing on agentic workflows and aiming to significantly transform a major industry.
